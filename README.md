## crazyvilllage.py
It provides instructions on how to use the Crazy Village application, which draws a village using the Turtle graphics library.
### Application Window
The application window displays a village with houses of different sizes and colors. The background of the window is black, and the title of the window is "Crazy Village".
### How It Works
The application uses the Turtle graphics library to draw the village. The code defines a function called domecek that draws a house. The function takes three arguments:
- **t:** The Turtle object that will be used to draw the house.
- **velikostDomecku:** The size of the house.
- **barva:** The color of the house.
The code then creates a new Turtle object and sets its properties, such as shape, speed, and pen size. The code then uses a for loop to draw 20 houses. For each house, the code generates special color and size, and then calls the domecek function to draw the house. The application draws a village with 20 houses of different sizes and colors. Houses are arranged in a spiral shape

## vesnice.py
It provides instructions on how to use the Levitating Village application, which draws a levitating village using the Turtle graphics library.
### Application Window
The application window displays a village with houses of different sizes and colors levitating in a black space. The title of the window is "Levitating Village".
### How It Works
The application uses the Turtle graphics library to draw the village. The code defines a function called domecek that draws a house. The function takes three arguments:
- **t:** The Turtle object that will be used to draw the house.
- **velikost:** The size of the house.
- **barva:** The color of the house.
The code then creates a new Turtle object and sets its properties, such as shape, speed, and pen size. The code then uses a for loop to draw 100 houses. For each house, the code generates a random position, color, and size, and then calls the domecek function to draw the house.

## pavucina.py
It provides instructions on how to use the Colorful Spider Web application, which draws a colorful spider web using the Turtle graphics library.
### Application Window
The application window displays a colorful spider web with intricate patterns. The background of the window is black, and the title of the window is "Spider Web".
### How It Works
The application uses the Turtle graphics library to draw the spider web. The code uses a for loop to draw 100 nodes, each of which consists of 3 loops. Each loop draws 4 edges, and the color of each edge is randomly generated. The distance between nodes increases as the web expands, creating a spiral pattern. The background of the window is black.

## kytice.py
It provides instructions on how to use the Flower application, which draws a flower using the Turtle graphics library.
### Application Window
The application window displays a flower with colorful petals. The background of the window is black, and the title of the window is "Flower".
### How It Works
The application uses the Turtle graphics library to draw the flower. The code defines two functions:
- **okvetniListky(t, s, count, col1, col2):** This function draws a layer of petals. It takes five arguments:
  - **t:** The Turtle object that will be used to draw the petals.
  - **s:** The size of the petals.
  - **count:** The number of petals in the layer.
  - **col1:** The fill color of the petals.
  - **col2:** The outline color of the petals.
- **kvetina(t, s, col1, col2, col3, col4):** This function draws a flower. It takes six arguments:
  - **t:** The Turtle object that will be used to draw the flower.
  - **s:** The size of the flower.
  - **col1:** The color of the outer petals.
  - **col2:** The alternate color of the outer petals.
  - **col3:** The color of the middle petals.
  - **col4:** The color of the center of the flower.
The code then creates a new Turtle object and sets its properties, such as speed and pen size. The code then calls the kvetina function to draw the flower.
