Drawing using Python Turtle

## crazyvilllage.py
It provides instructions on how to use the Crazy Village application, which draws a village using the Turtle graphics library.
### Application Window
The application window displays a village with houses of different sizes and colors. The background of the window is black, and the title of the window is "Crazy Village".
### How It Works
The application uses the Turtle graphics library to draw the village. The code defines a function called domecek that draws a house. The function takes three arguments:
- **t:** The Turtle object that will be used to draw the house.
- **velikostDomecku:** The size of the house.
- **barva:** The color of the house.
The code then creates a new Turtle object and sets its properties, such as shape, speed, and pen size. The code then uses a for loop to draw 20 houses. For each house, the code generates special color and size, and then calls the domecek function to draw the house. The application draws a village with 20 houses of different sizes and colors. Houses are arranged in a spiral shape

## vesnice.py
It provides instructions on how to use the Levitating Village application, which draws a levitating village using the Turtle graphics library.
### Application Window
The application window displays a village with houses of different sizes and colors levitating in a black space. The title of the window is "Levitating Village".
### How It Works
The application uses the Turtle graphics library to draw the village. The code defines a function called domecek that draws a house. The function takes three arguments:
- **t:** The Turtle object that will be used to draw the house.
- **velikost:** The size of the house.
- **barva:** The color of the house.
The code then creates a new Turtle object and sets its properties, such as shape, speed, and pen size. The code then uses a for loop to draw 100 houses. For each house, the code generates a random position, color, and size, and then calls the domecek function to draw the house.

## pavucina.py
It provides instructions on how to use the Colorful Spider Web application, which draws a colorful spider web using the Turtle graphics library.
### Application Window
The application window displays a colorful spider web with intricate patterns. The background of the window is black, and the title of the window is "Spider Web".
### How It Works
The application uses the Turtle graphics library to draw the spider web. The code uses a for loop to draw 100 nodes, each of which consists of 3 loops. Each loop draws 4 edges, and the color of each edge is randomly generated. The distance between nodes increases as the web expands, creating a spiral pattern. The background of the window is black.
